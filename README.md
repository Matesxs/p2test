# p2test
Testing script for project 2 from IOS course, VUT FIT

### Installation
You simply place the script into the same repository as your project.

### Running the script
```./p2test.py```
or
```./python3 p2test```

### Limitations
What you have to test yourself:
```
correct limits of arguments
correct memory deallocation
```

The test uses finite state machines to test each entity.
It is still in development and a lot of functionality is missing.
