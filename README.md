# p2test
Testing script for project 2 from IOS course, VUT FIT

### Installation
You simply place the script into the same repository as your project.

### Running the script
```./p2test.py```
or
```./python3 p2test```

If your executable hangs up or doesn't want to run, try running it with these arguments.
These are the defults used by test.
```
./proj2 20 5 0 50
```

### Limitations
What you have to test yourself:
```
limits of arguments
memory deallocation
random time generators
```

The test uses finite state machines to test each entity.
It is still in development and a lot of functionality is missing.
Test runs for 30 seconds by default and does not yet have a simple way to change this behavior.

If you find any error, that is not detected, please contact me.
